CHANGELOG
=========

For the next few days or weeks, we'll keep on pushing to master. However, we'll
adopt semantic versioning, Git tags and publish proper changelogs as soon as
possible. Minor releases and their bugfixes will live in independant branches
while developments will be performed in feature branches and merged on master.
Bugfixes as well, but they'll also be cherry-picked in release branches.

By the end of year 2017, the `1.0.0` should be available and extensively tested
for more than one year in a production environment. We usually test new
Kubernetes releases a few days after their publication (after the first bugfix
release gets live) on our Beta clusters in case you're wondering.
