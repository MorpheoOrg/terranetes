/*
 * Configuration for our AMI(s): the base CoreOS one to bootstrap... everything
 * actually !! We can use cloud-config files to add our users and public keys,
 * software that matters for us (etcd, flannel, kubernetes master, kubelet...)
 *
 * The discrimination between the images isn't done at the AMI level anymore,
 * which is a great thing: we won't need to automate the build of our AMIs, the
 * configuration is stored as text... but we don't need tools like Ansible or
 * Chef. Also we'll never ever pay for custom AMIs... the best of both world and
 * even more.
 *
 * Only thing to pay attention to: the Docker Image registry will need to be
 * internalized at some point (at least for our base images and also the public
 * ones we fetch from DockerHub when relevant) in order to make bootstraping
 * instances as fast as possible.
