/*
 * Bastion host that exists from cluster bootstrap and that can enable SSH
 * connection to any node in the cluster for authorized peers.
 *
 * NAT host that allows instances in private subnets to connect to the
 * to the Internet (to download Docker images, updates...)
 *
 * TODO FIXME: this is not optimal since it uses SSH Agent forwarding.
 * We should use a VPN connection instead. However, I'm a bit reluctant to
 * adding more dependencies on pure AWS components and AWS VPN connections
 * aren't really cheap.
