Contributing
============

Really feel free to open issues and, preferably PRs. You should respect
traditionnal git commit message formatting (title AND message, respecting the
standard max line length for both :) ) and Terraform-Format your code as
much as possible. Linus doesn't work with us though, whatever your committing no
one is going to insult you :D
Needless to mention that you can use Github PR tool :) (we'll take
care of merging your code while keeping the commit history neat and clean
anyways).

This code needs some love, a granular approach to security, a CNI plugin...
there's many ways it could be improved. All contributions are heavily welcome
and we'll be happy to work on your PRs with you and review them on short notice.
Also, we'll be able to answer all of your questions, for now in Github issues or
by e-mail (etienne@rythm.co), soon via a real chat. Oh and direct messages on
IRC (Sparadox on freenode) are fine as well. We'll put more "professional"
communication channels in place ASAP (probably a Gitter or a Slack chat, and if
possible an IRC channels as well. We're aware that a lot of sysadmin don't like
to leave their terminal and so do we :) ).

TODO: be a bit more specific...
